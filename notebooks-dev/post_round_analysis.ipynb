    "This app assesses the teams' performance of a past round. This is based on a league with *Head to Head Each Category* scoring type and 8 stat categories (FG%, FT%, 3PM, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TO, PTS).\n",
    "\n",
    "* It displays the 8 stat categories in addition to total minutes and games played by each team in a single table.\n",
    "* The ranking of the above stat categories, i.e. how each team is ranked for each category. \n",
    "* The score differential for all possible match-ups in the round. It gives a sense of how a team performed compared to the whole league, not just a single match-up.\n",
    "* The percentage wins of all possible match-ups. For example, a team might have won its match-up, but its percentage win is very low. This indicates a weak/lucky team which played against an even weaker opponent. Changes are still required. On the other hand, if a team lost a match-up, but its percentage win is high, it indicates a strong team which happened to play against the strongest opponent. Changes might not be required.\n",
